# Time Series Indexing - LABD
This is a project made for educational purpose for the course of [Laboratory on Algorithms for Big Data] ( University of Pisa ) 2016/17.

## Libraries
* [Cereal] - Serialization library
* [SDSL] - Succinct Data Structures Library
* [G-Test] - Google Unit Test

## Tech
* [CMake] - family of tools designed to build, test and package software

## Usage
Generate a makefile and build project:
```sh
$ mkdir _build
$ cd _build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
The executables will be placed in `_build/bin/`.  

### Indices
There are two different implementations, each of it is represented by an index:
* **0** : **Baseline** implementation
* **1** : Implementation with **succinct data structures**  

### Data serialization
```sh
$ cd _build/bin/
$ ./build_index id path/to/dataset
```
The object will be saved in the same folder of dataset file, with the same name plus the index id.  


### Build query sets
```sh
$ ./build_query_sets path/to/dataset num_of_query min_date_interval max_k
```
This one will build (min_date_interval\100)*max_k different set of queries each with different size of Range and K.
If there is a serialized data structure with id=0, the creation will be faster because doesn't needs to populate structure from file.  

### Run queries
```sh
$ ./run_queries id path/to/dataset path/to/query_set
```
## Test
Test index=0 implementation:
```sh
$ ./test_baseline
```
Test index=1 implementation:
```sh
$ ./test_index1
```
