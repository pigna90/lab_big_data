# Time Series Indexing - LABD

This is a project made for educational purpose for the course of [Laboratory on Algorithms for Big Data] ( University of Pisa ) 2016/17.

### Libraries
* [Cereal] - serialization library

### Tech
* [CMake] - family of tools designed to build, test and package software

### Usage
Generate a makefile and build project:
```sh
$ mkdir _build
$ cd _build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
The executables will be placed in `_build/bin/`.  

Data serialization:
```sh
$ cd _build/bin/
$ build_index id path/to/dataset
```
The object will be saved in the same folder of dataset file, with the same name plus the index id.  

Build query sets:
```sh
$ build_query_sets path/to/dataset num_of_query
```
This one will build three different set of queries each with different size of Range and K.  
If there is a serialized data structure with id=0, the creation will be faster because doesn't needs to populate structure from file.  

Run queries:
```sh
$ run_queries id path/to/dataset path/to/query_set
```
